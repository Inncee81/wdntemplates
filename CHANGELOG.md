## 4.0.19 (August 27, 2014)

### Added
- This change log to make it easier to see what was added, removed, fixed and deprecated for each future release.
- Added TIPS Incident Reporting logo to the footer

### Fixed
- The events widgets were updated to display dates/times in the Central timezone.  They were converting dates to the local timzeone, which was causing confusion because they did not used to act this way.  It was also an issue because all day events are considered to start at midnight, but the timezone conversion was causing all day events to start at 11pm on the day before.
- Prevent the events band widget from displaying a location with the name of 'null'.  If an event did not have a location defined, it was displaying as 'null'.
- The events-band plugin should support multiple instance (#792)
- Styles for the `.wdn-promo-band` and `<blockquote>` elements were updated for color and font-size
